## Scenario Description:
The database we’ve designed is a comprehensive solution tailored for managing and optimizing the operations of an E-commerce platform. At its core, it organizes critical data—such as customer profiles, products, orders, and payments—into structured, interconnected entities. This structure ensures seamless integration between different facets of the business, enabling efficient workflows and better decision-making. In the real world, this type of database is essential for E-commerce entrepreneurs for several reasons:

Enhanced Customer Experience: It allows businesses to personalize customer interactions, track preferences, and reward loyalty, fostering stronger relationships.

Operational Efficiency: Automating inventory management, order processing, and payment tracking reduces manual work and errors.

Scalability and Insights: The structured data supports advanced analytics, helping entrepreneurs identify trends, optimize pricing, and forecast demand.

Data-Driven Decisions: It enables entrepreneurs to gain actionable insights through queries and visualizations, which can improve strategies and profitability.

By leveraging this database, entrepreneurs can focus more on growth while the system handles the heavy lifting of data management."

Q1 Managerial Perspective: This query provides valuable insights into the behavior and value of high-spending customers. By identifying the top customers based on total spending, managers can focus on retaining these loyal and profitable individuals through targeted marketing campaigns, personalized offers, or loyalty program enhancements. Additionally, metrics like average order value and largest order help refine strategies to encourage higher spending per transaction. 


Query #2: Find the top 3 products by total revenue, with details on supplier, category, and inventory availability.

Q2 Managerial Perspective: This query highlights the most profitable products and their associated suppliers, categories, and stock levels. This information enables managers to prioritize inventory planning, supplier relationships, and product promotion strategies. Products with high revenue but low stock may indicate a need for restocking or renegotiating supply contracts. Additionally, the inclusion of discount rate filters ensures focus on sustainable revenue growth rather than heavily discounted products, which may affect margins.
